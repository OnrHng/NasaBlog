# Nasa Blog
In this Project I used Nasa APOD API to get astronomoy picture of the Day and Infos.
If you click an image , you can see full resolution of image. It is exactly excited.
And avaliablity you can add this image and info card into the your favorites and also remote from favorites.

For keep  the data I used localStorage. Site is also total responsive. I created custom loading animation 
using the Loaf Animated SVG Generator. You can find here => https://getloaf.io/
